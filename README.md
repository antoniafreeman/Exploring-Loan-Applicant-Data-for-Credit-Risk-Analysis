# Exploring-Loan-Applicant-Data-for-Credit-Risk-Analysis

This project investigates the following objectives:

Default Loan Prediction and Classification: Predicting whether an applicant is likely to default on a loan.
Optimal Credit Limit Prediction with Regression: Estimating the ideal credit limit for loan applicants.
Customer Segmentation with Clustering: Identifying distinct customer groups for targeted financial strategies.

# Key Highlights

Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formats to ensure data quality.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualised relationships and distributions of key variables.
Identified outliers and analysed trends in categorical data.
Summary statistics and linear relationships provided insights for model building.
Machine Learning Models:
Classification: Evaluated algorithms for predicting loan default and generated a detailed classification report.
Regression: Compared regression models for credit limit prediction and identified the best-performing approach.
Clustering: Applied clustering techniques to segment applicants into meaningful groups.
Results: Detailed visualisations, such as classification reports, model comparisons, and clustering diagrams, illustrate findings.

This project provides actionable insights into credit risk management, supporting financial institutions in decision-making processes like risk assessment, credit allocation, and customer targeting.
